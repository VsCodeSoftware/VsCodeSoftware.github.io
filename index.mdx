## Introduction

    Any changes that are done to the Obsidian library will be reflected in our [LinoriaLib UI Fork](https://github.com/mstudio45/linorialib).
</Callout>

## Why Obsidian?
- Clean and simple UI
- Full Mobile and PC support
- Customizable themes
- Built-in Save Manager
- Maintained UI Library

## Installation
Obsidian is available to use on **Roblox Studio**, **Executors** and even **Next.js + Tailwind**. Please refer to the [installation guide](./obsidian/installation).

## Quick Start
First understand the [structure](./obsidian/structure) of Obsidian **(This is important if you are not familiar with LinoriaLib)**

Then create a [window](./obsidian/core/library#Window) and start adding [tabs](./obsidian/structure/tabs) and [groupboxes](./obsidian/structure/groupboxes) to it.
If you are less into reading and more into checking code, the Obsidian example script can be found [here](https://github.com/deividcomsono/Obsidian/blob/main/Example.lua).
